👋 Hi, I’m @Halafakhro

👀 I’m interested in leveraging technology to advance healthcare, particularly through bioinformatics, digital health, and clinical decision support systems (CDSS). I am also interested in using bioinformatics in the early stages of drug discovery, focusing on genomic sequencing, structural bioinformatics, and sequence analysis.
🌱 I’m currently learning advanced bioinformatics techniques as I pursue a Master's in Bioinformatics and deepening my expertise in machine learning.
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on RNA sequencing, predicting new drug targets, and identifying new biomarkers projects.
